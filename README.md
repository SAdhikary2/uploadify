# Enterprise-Grade File Management System (Spring Boot + MySQL)

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable backend service for secure file management built using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**.
It implements a fully functional RESTful API that supports secure file upload, retrieval, and metadata handling with high performance and reliability.

Designed following enterprise architecture principles, the system uses modular abstraction through **Controller**, **Service**, **Repository**, and **Entity** layers, ensuring clean separation of concerns and easy extensibility.

## Key Features

* **Optimized File Processing:** Supports large file uploads with configurable multipart streaming parameters.
* **Database-Backed Storage:** Files are stored directly in the database as BLOBs using JPA and Hibernate to maintain consistency and data integrity.
* **Dynamic Download Endpoints:** Uses `ServletUriComponentsBuilder` for generating download URIs with automatic MIME type detection.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implements a custom exception hierarchy and standardized HTTP response models.
* **Cloud-Ready Design:** Can be extended to integrate with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for hybrid or distributed persistence strategies.
* **Transaction Management:** Adheres to Spring’s transaction management best practices for data safety.
* **Maintainable Architecture:** Clean layering makes it suitable for microservices or containerized environments.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a multi-tier architecture ensuring modularity and scalability.

```
Controller → Service → Repository → Database
```

**Controller:** Handles HTTP requests and maps them to corresponding service methods.
**Service:** Contains business logic, validation, and exception handling.
**Repository:** Manages database operations via Spring Data JPA.
**Entity:** Defines database schema with optimized BLOB field mappings.

## Configuration Example

```properties
# File Upload Configuration
spring.servlet.multipart.enabled=true
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=200MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=215MB

# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/file_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAdhikary2/uploadify.git
```

### 2. Configure the Database

Edit the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials.

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Test the Endpoints

Use Postman or cURL to verify file upload and download functionality.

**Upload Example:**

```bash
curl -F "file=@path/to/yourfile.txt" http://localhost:8080/upload
```

**Download Example:**

```bash
curl -O http://localhost:8080/download/{fileId}
```
